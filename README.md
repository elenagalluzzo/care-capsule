# Care Capsule
Care Capsule is a SwiftUI app built for the 2024 Swift Student Challenge that’s purpose is to assist the lives of the elderly, by providing easily accessible care from their mobile device. Care Capsule allows users to keep track of their medication schedule, monitor their tasks and appointments, provides companionship through a logic and machine learning based chatbot that also attempts to read and track their mental health through sentiment analysis, allows users to make a collection of positive memories to look back on, and provides mental health resources catered to older adults. 
I used several resources and apple technologies. For the assistant, I used AVSpeechSynthesizer for text to speech for improved accessibility by having it explain how to use the app sections and to speak chat responses out loud. The chatbot portion incorporates CreateML’s sentiment analysis, using the [Mental Health Corpus dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/mental-health-corpus/data) by Reihaneh Namdari to train the model to determine if a message shows signs of low mental health.  The medication schedules, tasks, and memories are persisted locally using SwiftData and the documents directory.

CareCapsule was built with Xcode Playgrounds and written in Swift 5X. The design was created using SwiftUI.
